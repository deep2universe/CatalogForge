# Color Theory for Catalog Design

## Color Harmony Principles

### Primary Color Usage
- Use brand colors consistently throughout the layout
- Primary color for headlines, CTAs, and key elements
- Limit primary color to 10-20% of the design

### Secondary and Accent Colors
- Secondary colors for supporting elements
- Accent colors for highlights and emphasis
- Maintain 60-30-10 color ratio

### Neutral Colors
- Use neutrals for body text and backgrounds
- Light neutrals (#F5F5F5 - #FFFFFF) for backgrounds
- Dark neutrals (#1A1A1A - #333333) for text

## Color Contrast Requirements

### WCAG Compliance
- Normal text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (18pt+): minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

### Print Considerations
- Avoid pure black (#000000) - use rich black (#1A1A1A)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for print reproduction
- Consider paper color when selecting backgrounds

## Color Application

### Product Images
- Use neutral backgrounds to highlight products
- Avoid competing colors near product images
- Consider color temperature consistency

### Technical Data
- Use subtle color coding for categories
- Maintain readability with high contrast
- Avoid color as the only differentiator
